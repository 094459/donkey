# Build a car

With donkey, you can build angle steering or differential steering vehicles. This document walks through how to build both types.


## Angle Steering
This vehicle steers uses a servo to angle its front wheles. Use these instructions if your modifying an RC car. 

### Components
* [Raspberry Pi 3 B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/) ($35)
* [Micro SD Card](https://www.sandisk.com/home/memory-cards/microsd-cards/extreme-microsd) (campatible with Raspberry Pi) ($8)
* [Raspberry Pi Camera V2](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/camera-module-v2/) ($15)
* [Adafruit Servo Sheild](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1411) ($22)
* [USB Battery Pack](https://www.anker.com/products/A1263011) ($15)
* RC CAR (($120-300)) (car recommendations)

### Custom Parts
These parts can be made using a 3D printer and laser cutter.
* Camera mount
* Base plate
* Roll bars 

If you don't have access to these tools you can build these components out of cardboard or foamboard. 


### Tools Needed
