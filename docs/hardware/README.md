##Mechanical Hardware Documentation
The hardware for the Donkey is fairly straight forward, however following it is pretty important.  It is to everybody's benefit that we end up with same/similar training data. Only two cars are supported right now:

*	Helion Invictus from Hobbytown
* 	Trooper from Hobby king (both Pro and non Pro version)

We will evaluate support for other cars on an ongoing basis.  

###Top Plate
The top plate is two parts laser cut from 3mm material like baltic birch plywood.  the two top plates are then glued together.  The current top plate is for the Helion Invictus, the Trooper will be added shortly. 

###Roll Cage
The roll cage is an optional part printed on a 3D Printer, it can be attached to the top plate using M3 screws <note: provide length>.  While optional the roll cage does help protect electronics, but possibly more importanly provides much needed handles for the car such that you dont touch wiring connections when moving the car. 

###Camera Holder
There are two camera holders one is short "camera holder.stl" and one is tall and has 3 camera position options "adjustable camera holder.stl.  The short one is now depricated.  Adjustable camera holder has 3 positions 0, -15 and -30 degrees.  The -30 degree setting is recommended for all data collection, other settings are available for testing.  Both camera holders are held down with M3 screws and optionally can use a square nut to for easier tightening.
