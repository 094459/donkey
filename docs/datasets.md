# Datasets

Donkey has several builtin datasets to help users test their autopilots and confirm that they can learn from image sequences. 

## Moving Square
A single color moving square bounces around the screen.

Outputs:
* X - 120x160px image of moving square on black background.
* Y - x and y cordinates of center of square in the image. (use options to only return x or y)
