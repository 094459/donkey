# Donkey: a self driving library for small scale DIY vehicles. 

Donkey is minimalist and modular self driving library written in Python. It is developed with a focus on being a toolbox to allowing fast experimentation for any hobbiest. 

####Use Donkey if you want to:
* quickly [build your own self driving RC Car](docs/01-build_a_car.md) with a Raspbery Pi.
* test out your self driving idea 


###Guiding Principles
* **Modularity**: A self driving system is composed of standalone, independently configurable modules that can be connected modules.

* **Minimalism**: Each component should be kept short (<100 lines of code). Each peice of code should be transparent apon first reading. No black magic, it slows the speed of innovation. 

* **Extensiblity**: New components should be simple to create by following a template. 

* **Python**: Keep it simple. 

***These guidelines are nearly copied from Keras because they are so good*** 



### Get started.
